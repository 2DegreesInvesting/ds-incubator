# ds-incubator

The goal of the ds-incubator (data science incubator) is to share best practices
in data-science at [2DII](https://2degrees-investing.org/) and beyond.

The main element of this project is an internal, online, weekly meetup. A series
of meetups covers a topic that is interesting to us and hopefully useful to the
broader data-science community. We vote which topic to cover based on a few
[suggestions](https://bit.ly/dsi-ideas) and contributed ideas.

Each series has:

* A GitHub issue that briefly describes the
series and guides the logistics of each meetup
([example](https://github.com/2DegreesInvesting/ds-incubator/issues/75)).

* A GitHub repository with a syllabus
([example](https://github.com/2DegreesInvesting/ds.reprex)).

Each meetup has:

* A folder in the series repo with the materials covered in that meetup
([example](https://github.com/2DegreesInvesting/ds.reprex/tree/master/01_overview)).

* A recording posted on the [ds-incubator
YouTube-playlist](https://bit.ly/ds-incubator-videos), including a link to the
relevant section of the syllabus.

* A post sharing the meetup recording with `#rstats` on twitter
([example](https://twitter.com/mauro_lepore/status/1447936387894976512?s=20)).
